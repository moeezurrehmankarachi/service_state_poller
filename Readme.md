<br>
A service that concurrently checks each "external service" for availability and marks "OK" only if HTTP 200 response is received. Otherwise "Failed" is marked. The service is written in a re The service schedule is configurable via Spring CRON expressions. A valid CRON expression is ```cron.expression = */20 * * * * *```, by which the service will execute every 20 seconds. Another example would be ```cron.expression = 0 */2 * * * *```, which will run every 2nd minute. These properties are defined in the ```application.properties``` file.
<br>If it is required to create the jar file use ```mvn clean package``` in the project directory. Use ```mvn clean package -DskipTests``` to make jar without running tests. The program can be run using ```java -jar target/service_state_poller-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```.

<br>If needed to run in IDEs such as Intellij Idea, all the projects can be used using the 'Application' run configuration and pointing to the classes with ```@SpringBootApplication``` annotation namely: ```com.task.service_state_poller.ServiceStatePollerApplication.java``` for poller service, ```com.task.backend.BackendApplication``` for backend application and ```com.kry.WebApp.Application``` for web application.<br/>
